  which happens to be more or less dependent on the type of tactics. To be
  able to perform tweaks in this type more easily in the future, we propose an
  API for building tactics which doesn't need to expose the type of tactics
  and yet has a fairly small amount of primitives. This API accompanies an
  entirely new implementation of the core tactic engine of Coq which aims at
  handling more gracefully existential variables (aka. metavariables) in
  proofs - like in more recent proof assistants like Matita and Agda2. We
  shall, then, leverage this newly acquired independence of the concrete type
  of tactics from the API to add backtracking abilities.",
